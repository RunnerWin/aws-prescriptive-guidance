Amazon Web Services (AWS) Prescriptive Guidance patterns provide step-by-step instructions, architecture, tools, and code for implementing specific cloud migration, modernization, and deployment scenarios. These patterns, which are vetted by subject matter experts at AWS, are meant for builders and hands-on users who are planning to, or are in the process of, migrating to AWS. They also support users who are already on AWS and are looking for ways to optimize or modernize their cloud operations.

You can use these patterns to move your on-premises or cloud workloads of varying complexity to AWS and to accelerate your cloud adoption, optimization, and modernization efforts, regardless of whether you're in the proof of concept, planning, or implementation phase of your project. For example, for a cloud migration project:

- In the planning phase, you can evaluate the different options available to migrate to AWS. You can choose the right pattern that fits your needs, depending on whether you want to relocate, rehost, replatform, or rearchitect. You can also understand the different tools available for migration, and start planning to procure licenses or start initial conversations with vendors.

- In the proof of concept and implementation phases, you can follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the pattern to migrate your workload to AWS. Each pattern includes details such as prerequisites, target reference architectures, tools, step-by-step tasks, best practices, troubleshooting, and code.

- If you're already using the AWS Cloud, you can find patterns that will help you modernize, optimize, scale, and secure your use of cloud resources.
